# Ethan's Advent of Code 2023

* Hello, this is my first advent of code
* I am starting this in the middle of finals week, and also will be out of the country for a good 10 days this month
* Nevertheless, I'll be attempting to solve some advent of code problems this year!

## Building and Running

* I am going to be using cmake and make and c++ for most of these

* build and run
```bash
cd day<num>
cmake .
make
./solve < test/input.txt
```
